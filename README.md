# Romancing SaGa:re:UniverSe JP-version data files

Those are data-files downloaded from JP game servers automatically on an hourly based.

They are enriched by using GL-version files to generate `_en` properties with the english name of objects.

When `_en_src` refers to `gl`, it means the data came from GL-version files. When it says `ml` it means it came form Amazon-powered machine learning translation.
